<p>Playstation 4 is a very good console. I would recommend buying a playstation. An average playstation would cosy around $300. The playstation in this photo is an exclusive playstation that would cost about $100-$400 more than the average playstation.A playstation runs at about 30-60fps and has a resolution of about 1080. The better graphics ps4 has over xbox are not too noticable, unless you are trying to find a diffence in them. The controller is also easy to use. Playstation online costs $9.99 for a month, $17.99 for three months, and $49.99 for a year. The prices for online, however will change to the same prices as xbox next year.
