<p>We are now shifting our gears from a Playstation 4, to an Xbox one. Personally I have never owned an Xbox, so I will be only using informantion from the web. The company that owns Xbox is Microsoft. An Xbox costs around $250, which is a lower price than a Ps4. An Xbox, just like a ps4 can hold 500GB. An Xbox plays games at 30-60fps, but has a resolution of 720-900. If you want a little more details in graphics press this link:<a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/ps4-vs-xbox-720-which-is-better-1127315/3">Graphics linkf</a></p>

<ol>An Xbox One includes
<li>Chat headphones.</li>
<li>A kinect camera.</li>
To power the Xbox, you would also need a power box, which comes with the xbox. The power box is one flaw with the xbox, since its an extra box you would need to put somewhere secure. The kinect camera is a merit because it comes with the xbox. Xbox live cost $5 a month, $25 for three month, $60 a year, or $10 a month on a back to back basis.</p>
