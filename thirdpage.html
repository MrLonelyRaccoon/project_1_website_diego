  <h3>Sony Playstation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One</h3>
  <p>A playstation 4 is a very good console, it is a little more expensive than an Xbox One. With the playstation costing at $300 and Xbox at $250. Xbox game bundles cost about the same price as a ps4. The size of the xbox one is bigger and weighs more than the ps4, and the power box also takes up some space. So the ps4 would be more easier to transport than the xbox. The link here shows how big the xbox is compared to the ps4.<a href="http://www.gamingreality.com/2013/06/ps4-vs-xbox-one-console-size-comparison.html">Sizes.</a></p>
  <p>Xbox Live costs more than playstation plus(online), with playstation plus $50 a year and xbox live $60 a year. Ps4 sold more consoles than Xbox. The ratio was 2:1, ps4 selling about 40million and Xbox selling about 20million consoles. Playstation has many good exclusive games, while xbox has some. The sharing options on playstation 4 is very simple and all it takes is one button to save a video. The playstation 4 also auto records up to 15 minutes(can be changed to record more time in options) of the last available gameplay. Xbox One, in alomst all packages, comes with a kinect camera that you can use to skype people while playing your games. This might seem pretty biased but I have, like I said in the beginning, never actually owned an Xbox. If you want to do more detailed researching these three links will guide you. <a href="http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/xbox-one-and-ps4-pros-and-cons-thread.453122813/">First Link</a> <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/ps4-vs-xbox-720-which-is-better-1127315">Second Link</a> <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/xbox-one-vs-ps4,review-2543.html">Third Link</a>
